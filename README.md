## My Plugins

### [insertElementsWithMenu.js](https://github.com/holroy/draw.io-plugins/blob/master/insertElementsWithMenu.js) â€“ Insert elements with meny

A draw.io plugin for inserting a custom text (or ellipse) element, either by keyboard Ctrl+Shift+T (or Ctrl+Shift+Q) or by menu. Inspired by the question [Looking for blackboard style note taking app (Scapple alternative)](//softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/q/21802/14982) from the [Software Recommendations](//softwarecs.stackexchange.com/) Stack Exchange site, I wrote an answer recommending [draw.io](//draw.io), and ended up creating this plugin to make it easier to insert a pure text element which could be linked.  

## Documentation of draw.io plugins

Hopefully, the [related wiki](//github.com/holroy/draw.io-plugins/wiki) will come to describe various aspects of how to use and develop draw.io plugins, like [How to install plugins](//github.com/holroy/draw.io-plugins/wiki/Install-draw.io-Plugin), or how to achieve various operation related to plugins.
